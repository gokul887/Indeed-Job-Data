Included File:
    indeed_job_scraping.py

Motivation:
    Simplifies the process for searching for software internships.

Current Working:
    - Takes 20 pages of relevant data from Indeed for software intern jobs
    - extracts html from the page and using Beautiful Soup finds relevant data
    - Build a mySQL database with the job data: job title, company, location, Company rating, salary, indeed url(as scraping the job description is not permitted)
